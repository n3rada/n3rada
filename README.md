Programming is mostly about thinking. Hacking is about thinking one step ahead.

## ðŸ“¦ Toolbox

### Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL / MSSQL)

These two tools are designed to **simplify complex T-SQL interactions** for Microsoft SQL Server environments. You can **impersonate any user** along the way **to the last linked server in your chain**. Both tools prioritize modularity, extensibility, and operator experience, following robust OOP practices and addressing real-world red team requirements. Each tool serves a distinct purpose.

- [mssqlclient-ng](https://github.com/n3rada/mssqlclient-ng.git): A Python3 tool built upon Impacketâ€™s `mssqlclient.py`, **ideal for external access**.
- [MSSQLand](https://github.com/n3rada/MSSQLand.git): The C# executable twin, **designed for beacon assembly execution and restricted environments**.

## Grab Bag

Some tools fit neatly into categories, while others belong in a grab bag of utilities:

- [msauth-browser](https://github.com/n3rada/msauth-browser): A Python3 tool that leverages Playwright browser automation to extract Microsoft OAuth tokens. Ideal for Microsoft Graph and M365 red team operations.
- [sapsxpg](https://github.com/n3rada/sapsxpg.git): If youâ€™ve ever worked with SAP during a penetration test, you know how cumbersome using `SXPG_CALL_SYSTEM` on a SAP server can be. This tool is for you.
